## Discussion - limitations

- only looking at the discussion on twitter, where many users are passive (only liking and sharing), not at newspapers or other social media where people might express their thoughts/opinions differently 
- maybe think of something else - the example papers only had 2 or 3 and they didn't seem to be that deep
